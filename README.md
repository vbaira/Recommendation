# Recommendation  
Implementation of Clustering and Cosine LSH Recommendation algorithms.  
**Clustering Recommendation** takes into consideration user data points that fall into the same cluster as the user in order to calculate the recommended items.  
**Cosine LSH Recommendation** takes into consideration the P nearest neighbors of the user (that are calculated using the Cosine LSH algorithm) in order to calculate the recommended items.
